ABOUT
-----

Virtual Services TCP/IP, or VServ TCP/IP for short, is a Java library that
enables you to easily manipulate IP and TCP packets.  It is intended for
use in conjunction with a library which generates packets, such as
VServ IPQ, as byte arrays.  At the moment it supports only IPv4 packet
manipulation.

The API is still in flux; some methods are missing and some existing
methods will likely be renamed.  If you would like something added,
please submit a patch in unified diff format.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

VServ TCP/IP requires J2SE 1.4 or greater to compile and run.


COMPILING
---------

The source code requires Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/) to compile.

  ant -projecthelp

will list all build targets in build.xml.  There are very few files
in the source tree:

  src/java  Java source code

When you compile the source with

  ant jar

the following jar file will be created and placed in the lib/ directory:

  vserv-tcpip-version.jar
