The code is written mostly in Java.
IntelliJ IDEA is recommended for coding (Community Edition is fine).

*(File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> ipscan -> Dependencies - move the right lib_xxx to the top)*.

## Building [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angryziber/ipscan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angryziber/ipscan)

JDK 1.6+ as well as Ant are required for building.

Using these tools you can build on any platform. The binaries are in the form of
`.jar` files and can be run with `java -jar <jar-file>`. Deb and rpm packages can
only be built on Linux. Building of Windows exe can be done on Linux as well.

On Ubuntu install the following packages:
```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk ant rpm wine
```
Note: *wine* is needed for building of Windows installer.

Install JDK and Ant on other platforms as you usually do it.

Then use Ant for building a package for your desired platform:
just type `ant` or `make` in the project dir for the list of available targets.

`ant current` would build the app for your current OS.

The resulting binaries will be put into the `dist` directory.
Run jar files with `java -jar <jar-file>`.
