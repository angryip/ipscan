This is the source code of Angry IP Scanner, a network scanner tool.

The code is written mostly in Java.
IntelliJ IDEA is recommended for coding, but Eclipse would do as well.

Building
========

JDK 1.6+ as well as Ant are required for building.

Using these tools you can build on any platform. The binaries are in the form of .jar files
and can be run with `java -jar <jar-file>'. Deb and rpm packages can only be built on Linux.
Building of Windows exe can be done on Linux as well.

On Ubuntu install the following packages:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk ant alien

Install JDK and Ant on other platforms as you usually do it.

Then use Ant for building a package for your desired platform:
just type `ant' or `make' in the project dir for the list of available targets.

The resulting binaries will be put into the `dist' directory.
Run jar files with `java -jar <jar-file>'.
