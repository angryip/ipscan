fetcher.ip=IP
fetcher.ip.info=Displays the scanned IP address.\nThis fetcher is mandatory and cannot be removed from the list.
fetcher.ping=Ping
fetcher.ping.info=Shows whether the host replies to ping requests and shows average packet roundtrip time to the host and back if it was detected (depending on the pinging method selected in the Preferences dialog).
fetcher.ping.ttl=TTL
fetcher.ping.ttl.info=Shows the TTL (Time To Live) value in ping reply packets (works only with ICMP pinging).\n\nThis value is usually decremented by each node in the network that forwards the packet, so if initial value is guessable (usually 64, 128, or 255), then the difference shows the distance to the host (in number of nodes).
fetcher.hostname=Hostname
fetcher.hostname.info=Shows the hostname of the host obtained by the reverse DNS lookup.\n\nThis is the registered host name on the DNS server and may be different from the host name configured on the machine itself.
fetcher.ports=Ports
fetcher.ports.info=Shows the list of open ports from the ones that were scanned.\n\nA port is open when it is possible to complete TCP handshake with it and estabilish a connection.\nYou can select scanned ports in the Preferences dialog.\n\nThe number in the column heading shows the current number of selected ports for scanning; '+' is shown if requested ports for each host are scanned as well.
fetcher.ports.filtered=Filtered Ports
fetcher.ports.filtered.info=Shows the list of filtered ports from the ones that were scanned.\n\nA port is filtered when no response is being received to the connection attempt within specified amount of time. If a port is filtered, then it is probably blocked by a firewall.
fetcher.comment=Comments
fetcher.comment.info=Shows the comments entered for the address using the IP Details window.\nThe comments are persisted and are shown when this host is scanned again.
fetcher.webDetect=Web detect
fetcher.webDetect.info=Detects the web server software name and version, if possible.\n\nWorks by sending a HEAD request and reading the Server HTTP header from the response.
fetcher.httpSender=HTTP Sender
fetcher.httpSender.info=Sends the specified textual requests to the specified TCP port (eg 80), retrieves the response and uses the specified regular expression to extract the needed information out.\n\nVery customizable, can be used for any textual protocol, like HTTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, etc. For advanced users.
fetcher.httpProxy=HTTP Proxy
fetcher.httpProxy.info=Detects whether a working HTTP proxy is running on the host on either port 3128 or the requested port loaded using File Feeder in host:port format.
fetcher.portText.custom=Custom
fetcher.netbios=NetBIOS Info
fetcher.netbios.info=Retrieves the NetBIOS information about Windows machines.\n\nThe response has the following format:\nDOMAIN\\USER@COMPUTER [MAC]\n\nWhere:\nDOMAIN - Windows domain or workgroup\nUSER - currently logged in user\nCOMPUTER - Windows computer name (may be different from DNS name)\nSome parts may be absent, depending on the response.\n\nNote that this won't work with machines that have firewall enabled (which are most modern installations).\nThis fetcher is provided mostly for feature-compatibility with version 2.x.
fetcher.mac=MAC Address
fetcher.mac.info=Resolves host's MAC address on the local network using the ARP protocol.\nWill not work for non-local network hosts.
fetcher.mac.vendor=MAC Vendor
fetcher.mac.vendor.info=Shows vendor's name that might have produced the network card with the resolved MAC address.

preferences.ports.addRequested.info=Feeders may support specifying requested ports in addition to addresses (e.g. File Feeder, in form of address:port)\nThis allows for rescanning of exported IP:Port list files.

text.gettingStarted=Dummy

text.gettingStarted1=Angry IP Scanner is an IP address scanner tool.\n\n\
It is used for scanning of IP addresses with the goal of finding alive hosts and gathering interesting information about each of them.\n\n\
You can start by specifying the IP addresses to scan (your local IP is entered by default) and clicking the Start button.

text.gettingStarted2=Main terminology:\n\n\
Feeder - generator of IP addresses for scanning. Angry IP Scanner provides various kinds of feeders: IP Range, Random, and IP List File. You can select a feeder using the combo box next to the Start button.\n\n\
Fetcher - gathers specific information about a host, e.g. ping time, hostname, open ports. Feeders usually represent columns in the scanning results list. You can select additional fetchers by choosing "Tools->Select fetchers" from the menu.

text.gettingStarted3=Main terminology (continued):\n\n\
Alive host - is the host, responding to pinging. These are blue in the results list.\n\n\
Dead host - is the host, not responding to pinging (red in the list). However, it may still have ports open (if firewall blocks pings). In order to scan these hosts fully, check "scan dead hosts" in the Tools->Preferences dialog.\n\n\
Open port - a TCP port, responding to connection attempts. Hosts with open ports are green in the results list.\n\n\
Filtered port - a TCP port, not responding that it is closed (no RST packet). These ports are usually specifically blocked by firewalls for some reason.

text.gettingStarted4=Pinging (checking if hosts are alive):\n\n\
Angry IP Scanner can use different methods for pinging hosts. You can choose between them in the Preferences dialog.\n\n\
ICMP echo - is the standard method used by the 'ping' program. This one requires administrator or root privileges on most platforms. Note that some firewall software disables sending of ICMP echo reply packets, making alive hosts appear like dead.\n\n\
UDP - sends UDP packets (datagrams) to one of the host's ports and sees if there is any response (either positive or negative). This is non-standard, but works without special privileges.\n\n\
TCP - tries to connect to port 80 (http) on the host. This may work better than UDP for some networks, but usually it is worse.\n\n\
UDP and TCP pinging most often doesn't properly detect routers or other network equipment.\n\n\
TTL (time to live) - this fetcher works only with ICMP pinging method. Its initial value is usually 64 or 128, and the difference represents the distance to the host in number of nodes it has travelled.

text.gettingStarted5=The results list displays the scanning results, one line per each scanned address.\n\n\
Using the Preferences dialog, you may configure to display:\n\
- all scanned hosts\n\
- only alive hosts\n\
- only hosts with any ports open\n\n\
Special values (also configurable):\n\
[n/s] - not scanned value that wasn't scanned at all (eg if the host is dead)\n\
[n/a] - the value is not available, but was scanned

text.crippledWindowsInfo=Thank you for trying Angry IP Scanner!\n\n\
However, keep in mind that consumer versions of Windows (e.g. Windows XP SP2 / Vista / 7) have limited ability to be hosts for scanning, due to removed RawSocket support and TCP connection rate limiting.\n\n\
Because of that, some preferences were changed for you, making scanning slower than on other operating systems.\n\n\
See the FAQ page on the website (use Help menu) for more information.

text.gnuJavaInfo=Thank you for trying Angry IP Scanner!\n\n\
The program is currently running under GNU Java (GIJ/GCJ) implementation.\n\n\
Unfortunately, this version of Java contains some bugs and limitations, which affect Angry IP Scanner.\n\n\
Known issues:\n- Slow startup\n- Preferences are not saved\n- TCP Pinger and port scanning can give false results\n\
\nPlease consider using Sun Java from http://java.com or OpenJDK/IcedTea\n\n\
or... help making Angry IP Scanner and GNU Java compatible by contributing to both projects :-)
